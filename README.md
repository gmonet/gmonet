Welcome to my GitHub page!  
My name is Geoffrey and I study the static and dynamic properties of water flow at the atomic scale. A whole branch of Physics that goes by the name of *nanofluidics*.  
In practice, much of my time is spent writing Python codes to investigate the results of experiments or molecular dynamics simulations. More broadly, I am also interested in high performance computing and machine learning (which I would love to spend more time on!).  

Have a look at some of the following repositories:
- [brownpy](https://github.com/gmonet/brownpy): a high-performance Python package to simulate Brownian dynamic in 2D system.
- [Gromacs](https://github.com/gmonet/gromacs): a fork of GROMACS that allows you to apply an electric field or a force field in an area of the simulation box.
- [my-lammps-simulation](https://github.com/gmonet/my-lammps-simulation): a repository collecting configuration files to perform nanofluidic simulations on LAMMPS.
